<p>
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language. Almost every
popular programming language these days is multi-paradigm, but in
the case of JavaScript this is not clear. To quote Douglas 
Crockford, the God of JavaScript programming: "JavaScript
is the world's most misunderstood programming language."
</p><p>
This quote is not entirely out of place, JavaScript is one of the 
only programming languages people tend to "just write", without
properly learning it. This document will cover the basics of 
programming in JavaScript and will also show a few patterns which
are widly used within the language. 
</p><p>
I hope that at the end of this tutorial you will see that 
JavaScript is an elegant and really powerfull language which can
stand up to most of the other modern languages. 
</p><p>
JavaScript was written in eight (8) days. Compare this to, for 
example, SmallTalk which was written in eight years and you can
conclude that it was a great accomplishment. You can also 
conclude that the final result was rushed. Both these conculsions
are true. Writing a language in eight days is not "smart". It is 
not the time you need to create a fully mature language. So as a
result JavaScript has a lot of bad parts. It is influenced by
Scheme and Self; from which it got it's closures, higher order
functions and Prototypal inheritance. From Java it got it's 
syntax, it's curly braces. This syntax is the main reason why 
people all over the world think they can already write JavaScript
when they know Java, C# or even C++. All of those other languages
are completely different from JavaScript. Well written JavaScript
code looks nothing like the other ones.
</p><p>
With this tutorial I try to shed light on a lot of different 
aspects of writing well structured JavaScript. I would encourage
you to learn by doing. I can recommend inventing a consistante 
problem domain and write an application for this domain over and
over in as many different languages and technologies as you can
get your hands on. Every itteration will become better and you 
can compare each technology to the other because the solutions
you build stay the same.
</p><p>
Later on in this tutorial I will introduce AngualrJS, AngularJS
is a well thought out MVC framework for writing single page web
applications. It is very powerfull and it makes it trivial to 
write well structured web application fully segmented and really
maintainable.
</p><p>
When talking about a web application you inadvertently need a 
backend system. A web server if you will. Further aling in this
tutorial I will introduce NodeJS as a high concurrency web server
which is easy to create and has very low complexity.

<h2>Equality</h2>
<p class="remark">To quote the godfather of JavaScript Douglass Crockford:</p>
<p>
    JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: === and !==, and their evil twins == and !=. The good ones work
    the way you would expect. If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then === produces
    true and !== produces false. The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if
    they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values. the rules by which they do that are complicated
    and unmemorable. These are some of the interesting cases:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    '' == '0'           // false
    0 == ''             // true
    0 == '0'            // true

    false == 'false'    // false
    false == '0'        // true

    false == undefined  // false
    false == null       // false
    null == undefined   // true

    ' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
</pre>
<p>
    The lack of transitivity is alarming. My advice is to never use the evil twins. Instead, always use === and !==.
    All of the comparisons just shown produce false with the === operator.
</p>
