<p>
Declarative programming is not something which can be explained
easilly. It is something which you must develop feeling for over
the course of many years. The short description is: "Do not tell 
the computer how to do it, tell it what to do."
</p><p>
So in the case of the reduce we told the computer that we wanted
to reduce the array of arguments to a single integer by 
multiplying the current value by the next value. How the computer
then runs through the list is no longer our problem. It might
parallelize the execution or send it off to some server, we don't
know and we should not care!

<p class="remark"> 
  In the next segment I will use very terse notation, this is not 
  because I do not want people to be able to read my code, but it
  is because this is the type of code we'll be seeing a lot in 
  librairies from other sources.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of the different array opperations which you can
natively do in JavaScript and which should always take president
over the 'for' loop:
</p>

<h2>Array.prototype.forEach</h2>
<p>
    The method 'forEach' iterates through a colletion, in JavaScript
    this is always an Array. Now as you can see it is not possible to 
    directly manipulate the Array, but, the forEach function can take
    three parameters, the first one is the currently iterated item, 
    the second is the index of the item in the Array and the third is
    the original Array. Armed with this information you can changed the
    n'th element of the original Array and so manipulate it.
</p>
<p class="remark">
    Manipulating an array with 'forEach' is not something which is 
    considered 'good practice'. Because of the Functional nature of 
    JavaScript it is adviced to think of objects as being 'immutable'
    this will give you a better way of working with objects and an
    overall more stable application.

<pre>
var namesArray = ['Carlos', 'Siegert', 'Bjorn', 'Ferdinand']; 
console.log(
    (function (names) {
        names.forEach(function (item, index, theOriginalArray) {
            theOriginalArray[index] = index + '  ' + item;
        });
        return names;
    }(namesArray)));
</pre>

<h2>Array.prototype.map</h2>
<p>
    The method 'map' is one of those methods which are really hard to
    start using, but once you do you'll never look back. Some people
    would tell you that you should not use 'forEach' but always use 
    'map'. This of course is silly. You use map when you want to map
    your current Array onto a new array. The 'map' function returns
    an Array. You could think of this as a 'Select' method in C#'s Linq.
</p>
<p>
    The 'map' function does not alter the original list in any way, making \
    it safe to use in an immutable environment.
</p>
<pre>
var namesArray = ['Carlos', 'Siegert', 'Bjorn', 'Ferdinand']; 
console.log(
    (function (names) {
        return names.map(function (name, index) {
            return index + '  ' + name; 
        });
    }(namesArray)));
</pre>

<h2>Array.prototype.some</h2>
<p>
    The 'some' function stops looping the first time the handler returns true.
</p>
<pre>
(function (numbers) {
    numbers.some(function (number) {
        console.log( number );
        return number % 5 === 0;
    });
}([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]));
</pre>

<h2>Array.prototype.every</h2>
<p>
The 'every' function stops looping the first time the handler returns true.
</p>
<pre>
(function (numbers) {
    numbers.every(function (number) {
        console.log( number );
        return number % 5 !== 0;
    });
}([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]));
</pre>
