<p>
    Declarative programming is not something which can be easily explained. It is something which you must develop
    feeling for over the course of many years. The short description is: "Do not tell the computer how to do it, tell
    it what to do."
</p>
<p>
    So in the case of the reduce we told the computer that we wanted to reduce the array of arguments to a single
    integer by multiplying the current value by the next value. How the computer then runs through the list is no
    longer our problem. It might parallelize the execution or send it off to some server, we don't know and we should
    not care!
</p>

<p class="remark"> 
    In the next segment I will use very terse notation, this is not  because I do not want people to be able to read my
    code, but it is because this is the type of code we'll be seeing a lot in libraries from other sources.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a list of the different array operations which you can natively do in JavaScript and which should always
    take president over the 'for' loop:
</p>

<h2>Array.prototype.forEach</h2>
<p>
    The method 'forEach' iterates through a collection, in JavaScript this is always an Array. Now as you can see it
    is not possible to directly manipulate the Array, but, the forEach function can take three parameters, the first
    one is the currently iterated item, the second is the index of the item in the Array and the third is n'th element
    of the original Array and so manipulate it.
</p>
<p class="remark">
    Manipulating an array with 'forEach' is not something which is considered 'good practice'. Because of the
    Functional nature of JavaScript it is advised to think of objects as being 'immutable' this will give you a
    better way of working with objects and an overall more stable application. In our section on OOP we'll take
    a closer look at working with 'locked' or 'immutable' objects.
</p>

<p>
    This next example demonstrates manipulating the original array, try to never, ever do this! But if you need to;
    here's the code:
</p>

<pre>
var namesArray = ['Carlos', 'Siegert', 'Bjorn', 'Ferdinand']; 
console.log(
    (function (names) {
        names.forEach(function (item, index, theOriginalArray) {
            theOriginalArray[index] = index + '  ' + item;
        });
        return names;
    }(namesArray)));
</pre>

<h2>Array.prototype.map</h2>
<p>
    The method 'map' is one of those methods which are really hard to start using, but once you do you'll never look
    back. Some people would tell you that you should not use 'forEach' but always use 'map'. This of course is silly.
    You use map when you want to map our current Array onto a new array. The 'map' function returns an Array. You
    could think of this as a 'Select' method in C#'s Linq.
</p>
<p>
    The 'map' function does not alter the original list in any way, making it safe to use in an immutable environment.
</p>
<pre>
var namesArray = ['Carlos', 'Siegert', 'Bjorn', 'Ferdinand']; 
console.log(
    (function (names) {
        return names.map(function (name, index) {
            return index + '  ' + name; 
        });
    }(namesArray)));
</pre>

<h2>Array.prototype.some</h2>
<p>
    The 'some' function stops looping the first time the handler returns true.
</p>
<pre>
(function (numbers) {
    numbers.some(function (number) {
        console.log( number );
        return number % 5 === 0;
    });
}([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]));
</pre>

<h2>Array.prototype.every</h2>
<p>
The 'every' function stops looping the first time the handler returns true.
</p>
<pre>
(function (numbers) {
    numbers.every(function (number) {
        console.log( number );
        return number % 5 !== 0;
    });
}([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]));
</pre>

<h2>Taking declarative programming one step further</h2>
<p>
    Declarative programming goes deeper then just the functions on arrays. In JavaScript we can use object notation to
    create a declarative definition of our 'pipelines' and JavaScript being the dynamic language that it is will reap
    it's fruit right off the bat. Let's look at an example:
</p>

<pre>
    var process = [
        {
            index: 0, action: 'getEmptyCustomer', description: 'Get a default empty customer',
            validation: [
                { field: 'firstName', test: 'required' }
            ]
        },
        {
            index: 1, action: 'saveCustomer'
        }
    ];

    var context = {
        getEmptyCustomer: function () {
            return { firstName: 'Peterson' };
        },
        saveCustomer: function (customer) {
            customer.saved = true;
            console.log( JSON.stringify( customer, null, 4 ) );
            return true;
        },
        validate: function (target) {
            if (this.test === 'required') {
                return target[this.field] !== undefined && target[this.field] !== null;
            }
            else {
                return true;
            }
        }
    };

    process
        .sort(function(step_a, step_b) {
            return step_a.index - step_b.index;
        }).map(function(step) {
            context.result = context[step.action].call(step, context.result);
            if (step.validation && step.validation.length > 0) {
                step.validation.forEach(function(rule) {
                    context.validate.call(rule, context.result);
                });
            }
        });
</pre>
<p class="remark">
    Imagine this code in C#, we would have to create multiple classes, use generics for type safety and create a
    whole mess of calls and reflection to manage this simple example.
</p>
<p>
    Now take this one step further and add our decorated log function from the previous chapter and use this
    function to log out our message. In our current example I know that our parameter is an object. Our logger
    does not know this. I could write a decorator which can transform the object to a string and pass this as the
    message.
</p>

<p>
    This chapter shows how easy it is to program in another paradigm when using JavaScript. In the next chapters we
    will look at individual 'tricks' used in this code. The next chapter will look at the first construct used; Arrays!
