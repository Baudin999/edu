<p>
Functional programming is one of those terms which is used to 
describe a way of programming in which functions are the main
aspects of the language. In JavaScript there is no difference 
between a function and an object other than that a function can
be invoked and an object can't.
</p><p class="remark">
Functions will be discussed at length later on in this tutorial,
I will now focus on some aspects which are needed in order to get 
rolling with JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript does not require you to stick to the signature of your
function. And because it is loosly typed there is no return type
specified. The following example shows how to define a function in
JavaScript:
</p>

<pre class="ignore">
function multiply (x, y) {
    return x * y;
};
</pre>

<p>
Just like every other statement in JavaScript we end function
statements and function expressions with a semicolon. JavaScript
has automatic semicolon insertion but you would be well adviced 
to discount that feature and add the semicolos yourself. 

You invoke the method as folows:
</p>

<pre>
function multiply (x, y) {
    return x * y;
};
var multiplicationOfNumbers = multiply( 3, 4 );
console.log( multiplicationOfNumbers );
</pre>

<p>
Because you do not have to specify the number of arguments of a
function with the invocation of the function a function has a 
member called arguments which behaves like an Array but isn't
you can use this arguments member to iterate over the parameters
of the function like so:
</p>

<pre>
function multiply2 () {
    var result = 1;
    for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; ++i) {
        result = result * arguments[i];
    }
    return result;
};

console.log( multiply2(2,3,4) );
</pre>

<p class="remark">
    The 'arguments' member of a function is not a true Array, this will
    be remedied in ES6. In ES6 we will get a multitude of 'good parts'
    added to the language. There will also a few 'bad parts' which we
    will discuss in later parts of this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a code snippet which will transform the 'arguments' member of
    a function to an actual Array; do not worry if you cannot follow the 
    reasoning of this function. Just think of it as 'strange' way of calling
    a method of an object. We will discuss this syntax when we look at the 
    'this' parameter.
</p>
<pre>
var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
</pre>
<p>
Because JavaScript is a functional language (not a pure functional 
language, but a functional language none the less) we should write
our code more declaratively. So in this case we could reduce the 
list of arguments, but first we'd need to create an array from the
arguments. This is very strange and don't worry about the syntax 
yet, we'll get to this cast in a later chapter.
</p>

<pre>
/**
* Multiply an array of numbers with each other
*/
function multiply3 () {
    /* force the 'arguments' into an Array. */
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
    
    /* reduce the args into a single return value */
    return args.reduce(function (a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }, 1);
};

console.log( multiply3( 2, 3, 4, 10 ) );
</pre>
