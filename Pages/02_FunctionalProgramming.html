<p>
    Functional programming is one of those terms which is used to describe a way of programming in which functions are
    the main aspects of the language. In JavaScript there is no difference between a function and an object other than
    that a function can be invoked and an object can't.
</p>

<p class="remark">
    Functions will be discussed at length later on in this tutorial,
I will now focus on some aspects which are needed in order to get 
rolling with JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript does not require you to stick to the signature of your
function. And because it is loosely typed there is no return type
specified. The following example shows how to define a function in
JavaScript:
</p>

<pre class="ignore">
function multiply (x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
</pre>

<p>
    Just like every other expression in JavaScript we end function expressions with a semicolon. JavaScript has
    automatic semicolon insertion but you would be well advised to discount that feature and add the semicolons
    yourself. You can invoke the method as follows:
</p>

<pre>
function multiply (x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
var multiplicationOfNumbers = multiply( 3, 4 );
console.log( multiplicationOfNumbers );
</pre>

<p>
    Compare this to:
</p>

<pre>
function multiply (x, y) {
    return
        x * y
}
var multiplicationOfNumbers = multiply( 3, 4 );
console.log( multiplicationOfNumbers || 'undefined' )
</pre>

<p>
    The problem with the second piece of code is that automatic semicolon-insertion came in and inserted a semicolon
    right after the return statement, resulting is a return value of 'undefined'.
</p>

<p>
Because you do not have to specify the number of arguments of a
function with the invocation of the function a function has a 
member called arguments which behaves like an Array but isn't
you can use this arguments member to iterate over the parameters
of the function like so:
</p>

<pre>
function multiply2 () {
    var result = 1;
    for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; ++i) {
        result = result * arguments[i];
    }
    return result;
}

console.log( multiply2(2,3,4) );
</pre>

<p class="remark">
    The 'arguments' member of a function is not a true Array, this will
    be remedied in ES6. In ES6 we will get a multitude of 'good parts'
    added to the language. There will also a few 'bad parts' which we
    will discuss in later parts of this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a code snippet which will transform the 'arguments' member of
    a function to an actual Array; do not worry if you cannot follow the 
    reasoning of this function. Just think of it as 'strange' way of calling
    a method on an object. We will discuss this syntax when we look at the
    'this' parameter and OOP.
</p>
<pre>
var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
</pre>
<p>
Because JavaScript is a functional language (not a pure functional 
language, but a functional language none the less) we should write
our code more declaratively. So in this case we could reduce the 
list of arguments, but first we'd need to create an array from the
arguments.
</p>

<pre>
/**
* Multiply an array of numbers with each other
*/
function multiply3 () {
    // force the 'arguments' into an Array.
    var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
    
    // reduce the args into a single return value
    return args.reduce(function (a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }, 1);
}

console.log( multiply3( 2, 3, 4, 10 ) );
</pre>

<p>
    Functions are real entities in JavaScript we can pass them as parameters to other functions and return them
    as return values from functions; these are sometimes called 'higher order functions'. The next example shows a
    common pattern in JavaScript, this decorates a function with some helper information:
</p>

<pre>
function log (message) {
    console.log( message );
}

function dateDecorator () {
    var originalLogger = log;

    log = function (message) {
        message = new Date() + ': ' + message;
        originalLogger( message );
    };
};

dateDecorator();
log( 'Hello World' );

</pre>

<p>
    Because functions live within the scope of your application you can invoke them immediately after creating them,
    this next pattern is called a <i>self executing function</i>.
</p>

<pre>
(function log (message) {
    console.log( message ) ;
}('execute'));
</pre>

<p>
    The extra parentheses around the function are necessary but their position can vary. By convention we put them
    around the function and the parameter with which they are called. But you will encounter the following:
</p>

<pre>
(function log (message) {
    console.log( message ) ;
})('execute');
</pre>

<p class="remark">
    We will certainly find this convention broken in jQuery libraries. There are many ways to achieve separation in
    your code and there are even more ways to make your code unreadable in JavaScript. We should always follow strict
    coding standards with JavaScript or we'll quickly run into maintenance problems.
</p>
