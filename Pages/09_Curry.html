<p>
In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that
takes multiple arguments (or a tuple of arguments) into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single
argument (partial application). It was introduced by Moses Sch√∂nfinkel[1][2][3] and later developed by Haskell
Curry.

<p class="remark">
    With curried functions you get easier reuse of more abstract functions, since you get to specialize. Let's say
    that you have an adding function...
</p>

<pre>

    if (typeof Function.curry !== 'function') {
        Function.method('curry', function() {
            var args = Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments),
            self = this;

            return function() {
                return self.apply(null, args.concat(Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments)));
            }
        });
    }

    var add = function(x, y) {
        return x + y;
    };

    var addOne = add.curry(1);

    console.log( addOne(2) );

</pre>

<p>
    Now you may rightfully ask: "Why would I ever need this?"
    Imagine creating some function which manipulates a DOM element, to be more specific, imagine you wanting to
    change the innerText of a paragraph element. You want to do this for a given element. Now you could achieve this
    using closures like so:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    var setInnerText = (function ($element) {
        return function (text) {
            $element.text(text);
        }
    }($('.target')));
</pre>

<p>
    Now imagine us currying this:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    function setInnerText ($element, text) {
        $element.text(text);
    };

    var myTargetElementInnerTextFunction = setInnerText.curry($('.target'));
</pre>
<p>
    Not only is this code much cleaner and better readable. We also think more declaratively. Our
    <code>setInnerText</code> function is exactly what we would like it to be. Our partial application is readable and
    the total is more maintainable.
