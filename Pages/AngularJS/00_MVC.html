<h1>MVC</h1>
<p>
    Although originally developed for desktop computing, model–view–controller has been widely adopted as an
    architecture for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several commercial and noncommercial
    web application frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These frameworks vary in their
    interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server.
</p><p>
    Early web MVC frameworks took a thin client approach that placed almost the entire model, view and controller
    logic on the server. In this approach, the client sends either hyperlink requests or form input to the controller
    and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on
    the server.[8] As client technologies have matured, frameworks such as AngularJS, Ember.js, JavaScriptMVC and
    Backbone have been created that allow the MVC components to execute partly on the client
</p>
<p>
    We will focus on AngularJS as a client side MVC framework, but I would like to quickly categorise the other
    client side MVC frameworks out there:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Backbone.js</dt>
    <dd>
        Completely unopinionated framework, one of the oldest and it gives you the most freedom. BackboneJS
        was influenced by Python's Django framework, Ruby and Haskell. Jeremy Ashkenas the creator of
        Backbone.js also created underscore.js and CoffeeScript.
    </dd>
    <dt>EmberJS</dt>
    <dd>Very opinionated framework, influenced by Knockout and Rails</dd>
    <dt>AngularJS</dt>
    <dd>Right in between BackboneJS and EmberJS, as inspiration Silverlight and WPF are named.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    I was personally influenced by both Silverlight and WPF. This is why AngularJS was a natural choice for me.

<p class="remark">
    I think there are a lot of people for whom they just want to be on whatever the most popular bandwagon is, right?
    I think that if you’re choosing a JavaScript library purely based on popularity, I think you deserve what you get.
    But I think there are applications that Angular is really great for and there are applications that Backbone is
    really great for and things where you would just use jQuery. So I certainly believe in choosing the right tool
    for the job. - Tom Dale (creator of EmberJS)
