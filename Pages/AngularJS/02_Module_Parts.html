<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>
    Modules are containers for the different parts of your application. Inspecting a module object at runtime gives us
    the following members:
</p>

<p>
    We will look at all of these members in this document. In the code examples we will see examples of how to use
    most of them. Before we continue we need to filter a few of these members. Following a convention, the members
    starting with an <code>_</code> are considered private and can be ignored.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>config</code> and <code>run</code> members are actually ways to hook into the run and config phases of
    an AngularJS application. We will discuss these once we get the basics of AngularJS down.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>provider</code> is a beast we will focus on in the last part of this session. Once you master the provider
    you will see that the other members (which are all functions) are convenience wrappers for this provider. The only
    other member we will be ignoring is the <code>animation</code> member, because Animation is out of scope for these
    session. Our remaining members are:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Values</li>
    <li>Constant</li>
    <li>Controller</li>
    <li>Services</li>
    <li>Factories</li>
    <li>Directives</li>
    <li>Filters</li>
</ol>

<p>
    First, lets start by creating a module:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    angular.module('name', []);
</pre>

<p>
    As you can see a module is easily created. You pass it a name and a list of dependencies. Angular will do the rest.
    Imagine a second module called <code>Theme</code> (I use a separate module for my themes and ain layout). Our
    application depends on this <code>Theme</code> module. The code would look something like this:
</p>

<pre class="ignore">
    angular.module('theme', []);
    angular.module('app', ['theme']);
</pre>

<p>
    The module function returns the actual module, so you can either store this module in a variable or you can use
    a fluent syntax to just append calls to the module. Resources defined within module A referenced by module B are
    callable within module A. In our previous example I could create a value in our theme module and use this value
    within our application. The following code gives a contrived example:
</p>

<pre>
    angular
        .module('theme', [])
        .value('profile', { username: 'George', type: 'Monkey', state: 'Curious' })

    angular.module('app', ['theme'])
        .controller('mainController', function($scope, profile) {
            $scope.title = profile.state + ' ' + profile.username;
        });

<p>
    Another way you can think of a module is thinking of it as a DI container. The members like controller and service
    are used to register objects on your DI container. The main AngularJS module is called <code>ng</code>. Here you will
    find things like <code>$http</code> and a reference to the DI container <code>$injector</code>. Later in this
    series we'll dive deeper into the DI contianer when we discuss <code>$scope</code> and the $digest cycle.
</p>

<p>
    With this last example we can jump right into the first member or a module.
</p>

<h2>Value</h2>
<p>
    The value member on a module defines a key/value pair (also called a tuple in functional programming) with you can
    later retrieve. I use this for values I do not want to mutate 'much' within my application. I also use this to
    initialize values from the localStorage into my AngularJS application.
</p>

<p>
    We can always come back and update the value; the following code example shows this. Don't worry if there are
    pieces which you cannot follow, you will at the end of this course.
</p>

<pre class="ignore">
var app = angular.module('app', []);

angular
    .module('theme', [])
    .value('profile', {
        username: 'George',
        type: 'Monkey',
        state: 'Curious'
    });

angular.module('app', ['theme'])
    .controller('mainController', function ($scope, $injector, $timeout, profile) {
        $scope.title = profile.state + ' ' + profile.username;

        $timeout(function () {
            profile.state = 'Curiousser';
            angular.module('theme').value('profile', profile);

            $injector.invoke(['profile', function (p) {
                console.log(p);
            }]);

        }, 3000);
    });
</pre>

<h2>Constant</h2>
<p>
    A constant is a constant. This cannot change and is there to remain accessible but not mutable. I almost never use
    this. I've used it once to define some global UI settings like minimum width and a few colors.
</p>

<h3>Controller</h3>
<p>
    A controller is what makes MVC possible. The Controller is the 'C' part of MVC with the M being model and the 'V'
    being view. A lot of times I read blogs and items on the internet where people confuse the $scope (which can be
    passed into a controller through DI) and the 'M' model in MVC. The model is not the $scope but the $scope stitches
    the model and the view together. It's basically the glue holding the two together. It is also the way change tracking
    works in AngularJS (also called dirty checking).
</p>

<h2>Services and Factories</h2>
<p>
    I will look at Services and Factories at the same time because the do not differ that much:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    app.factory('titleFactory', function () {
        return {
            title: 'From the factory!!'
        };
    });

    app.service('descriptionService', function () {
        this.description = 'This is teh description from the descriptionService!!';
    });
</pre>
<p>
    A factory returns an object. A service has 'this' set to the returning object.
