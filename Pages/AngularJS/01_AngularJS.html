<p>
    AngularJS is a client side framework which allows us to write
    MVC style applications right in the browser. The reason why 
    we would want MVC is that this is a clear and unobtrusive 
    pattern which we can use to structure our application. When 
    you write large applications you tend to 'lose' control over
    the location of your files in the project. You also tend to 
    need to read more and more code. When you get the chance to
    segment your code into little bit sized peices you can find
    your code faster and be more productive. So in the end we use
    MVC in order to get more productive.

    Why AngularJS? HTML is great for declaring static documents, 
    but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic 
    views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML 
    vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment 
    is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
</p>

<p>
    A standard AngularJS application consists of declarative markup
    combined with backing <i>models</i>. You can extend HTML with
    your own elements and attributes making your markup more 
    readable and your application better maintainable. Lets look at
    a simple AngularJS example:
</p>

<pre class="ignore prettyprint linenums lang-html"><xmp>
    <html ng-app="app">
        <head>
            <title>First example</title>
        </head>
        <body ng-controller="mainController">
            <h1>{{ title }}</h1>

            <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
            <script>
                angular

                    // declare a module
                    .module('app')

                    // create a controller
                    .controller('mainController', function($scope) {
                        $scope.title = 'Hello Angular!!';
                    });
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
</xmp></pre>

<p class="remark">
    You can see the fluent implementation on the 'angular' keyword. 
    This is because AngualarJS is aware of the Functional nature of
    JavaScript and as such tries to be immutable. Immutable objects
    tend to return new instances of themselves exposing the same
    methods creating a fluent programming interface.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at the different parts of the application because we
    have a lot going on here. First thing to notice is that we include
    angular.js on line 9 of the code. This is where it all starts. To 
    understand the execution of a web page we'll need to take a look 
    at how flow and reflow work. Suffice it to say that scripts are
    loaded after each other. This is why we do not have to wrap our
    own script in some <code>onload</code> type of wrapper.
</p>

<p>
    For each of these examples I will make a fiddle. As the name suggests
    you can fiddle around with these features. For the big examples I will
    create a github repository and use this repo to set up everything you
    need to get going on your own. Because we cannot controll a fiddle's
    html tag we will have to <i>bootstrap</i> the AngularJS application 
    at runtime. We will look at the method once we start building bigger
    applications with more modules and requireJS.
