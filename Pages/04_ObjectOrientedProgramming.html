<h1>Objects</h1>

<p>
    Objects in JavaScript might be the second most disliked feature of the language. JavaScript uses prototypal
    inheritance instead of the classical inheritance which we know form languages like C# and Java. JavaScript
    does not have classes. Classes "define" the type of an object. In JavaScript you just create the objects and
    if and only if there is reason for inheritance you inherit.
</p>
<p>
    This concept can seem very 'brittle' and hard to create and maintain, but as you will see in this chapter, nothing
    is further from the truth. We we actually come to see that creating and manipulating objects in JavaScript is
    very easy and is in almost all aspects 'better' then the classical way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
    In JavaScript we can create an object by just typing it out; this is called an object literal:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    var newObject = {};
</pre>
<p>
    Before we continue with our code examples we need to address the elephant in the room. 'Dynamic languages' vs.
    'Static languages'. A static language is a language where once a variable is bound to a type you cannot change
    the type of this variable any more. For example, this is not allowed in C# but very valid in JavaScript:
</p>
<pre class="ignore">
    var foo = 2;
    foo = 'hi!';
</pre>
<p>
    This is the only difference between static and dynamic languages. This is a reason why IDEs have such a hard
    time providing intellisense and other tooling for the real dynamic languages. Another reason why it's hard to
    provide good tooling is that you never know, until runtime, which properties are on your object. Later on I will
    provide a few examples:
</p>

<p>
    Members can be added seperated by a comma:
</p>
<pre>
    var newObject = {
        name: 'Carlos Kelkboom',
        showName: function () {
            console.log( this.name );
        }
    };
    
    newObject.showName();
</pre>

<p>
    After creating an object they can be manipulated and changed. You
    can add methods and properties to the object.
</p>
<pre>
    var newObject = {
        name: 'Carlos Kelkboom'
    };
    newObject.showName = function () {
        console.log( this.name );
    };
    
    newObject.showName();
</pre>
<p class="remark">
    This is a very powerfull feature and as always, with great power comes great responsibility. To again quote
    Douglass Crockford: "Please don't be stupid with this, because you can get very stupid with this!".
</p>
<p>
    We can also use <code>Object.create</code> to create an object in JavaScript. Object.create also gives
    us a chance to introduce inheritance of objects:
</p>
<pre class="">
    var newObject = Object.create(null);
    console.log( JSON.stringify( newObject.__proto__ ) || 'Nothing...' );

    var newObject2 = Object.create({});
    console.log( JSON.stringify( newObject2.__proto__ ) );
</pre>
<p>
    If we wanted to let the new object share some properties from a parent object we could do:
</p>
<pre>
    var base = { title: 'Something' };
    var child = Object.create( base );
    console.log( child.title );
</pre>
<p>
    This method is fairly safe to use, for example when we change the child's property <code>title</code> we do not
    change the parent's <code>title</code>. The following code illustrates this.
</p>
<pre>
    var base = { title: 'Something' };
    var child = Object.create( base );
    child.title = 'Changed by child';
    console.log( base.title );
</pre>
<p>
    <code>Object.create</code> also takes a second optional parameter and this is a set of properties defined with a
    property description object and these properties will also be added to your object. Further into this tutorial we
    will look at these property description object.
</p>
<pre>
    var base = { title: 'A car' };
    var field = 'Mustang'
    var copySource = {
        spec: {
            enumerable: true,
            get: function () {
                return field;
            },
            set: function (value) {
                field = value;
            }
        }
    };
    var child = Object.create( base, copySource );
    console.log( child.spec );

</pre>


<h2>Dynamic functions</h2>
<p>
    Just like properties you can add functions to an object at runtime.
    There is however another syntax you can use to define functions on
    an object, this is a part of the property description object:
</p>
<pre>
    var o = {};
    Object.defineProperty( o, 'say hi!', {
        value: function (message) {
            console.log( message );
        }
    });
    
    o['say hi!']('Hi there Peter!!');
</pre>
<p>
    In JavaScript we can use any string as a member name. In ES6 we can 
    use any object to define a member. This will bring some interesting
    patterns to the language.
</p>

<h2>Getters and Setters</h2>
<p>
    As of ES5 we can implement getters and setters, values and other
    properties of a member, the first example will show us how to 
    create a property on the object. Keep in mind that we are using 
    a self executing method because we want the property to close 
    around the private field!
</p>
<pre>
    var o = {};
    
    (function () {
        var field;
        Object.defineProperty( o, 'name', {
            get: function () {
                return field;
            },
            set: function (value) {
                field = value;
            }
        });
    }());
    
    o.name = 'Peter Pan';
    
    console.log( o.name );
</pre>
<p>
    We might want to keep the backing field 'closer' to the implementation
    of the getter and the setter. This reduces the distance of our code and
    makes it possible to inject an implementation of automatic properties
    onto the prototype of Object. An arguably better way to implement this 
    is to write:
</p>
<pre>

    var o = {};
    
    Object.defineProperty( o, 'name', (function () {
        var field;

        return {
            get: function () {
                return field;
            },
            set: function (value) {
                field = value;
            }
        }
    }()));
    
    o.name = 'Peter Pan';
    
    console.log( o.name );
</pre>

<p>
    Keep in mind that if you are going to implement a simple getter
    and simple setter you might as well just push the property onto
    the object as show in the very first example.
</p>
<p>
    Within the JavaScript community implementing getters and setters
    with behaviour like this is considered 'bad code'. This is because
    you intentionally add side-effects to your code, this means that
    it is no longer possible to completely verify your code.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript takes this idea of side-effect free programming one step 
    further and introduces 'Object.freeze', this freezes an object and
    makes it immutable.
</p>

<pre>
    var person = {
        firstName: 'Peter',
        lastName: 'Pan'
    };
    
    Object.freeze(person);
    
    try { 
        person.firstName = 'Wendy'; 
    } 
    catch (e) { 
        console.log(e); 
    }
    
</pre>



<h2>Types in JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript is a loosly typed language. This does not mean that JavaScript 
    does not have types. It means that you do not have to specify them at 
    design time. An example of the typing in JavaScript:
</p>

<pre>
    console.log( 'Ik ben: ' + 30 + ' jaar oud.' );
</pre>

<p>
    Somehow the runtime knew that it had to cast the Number to a String. This
    is what implicit typing is all about. Again, this is something you can
    tie into declarative programming and fuctional programming. Lots of 
    Functional programming languages use something called type inference to
    determine the type and for example the return value of functions.
    This makes the code (in my opinion) rather clean.
</p>
<p>
    We can verify that JavaScript has types by evaluating the following code:
</p>

<pre>
    console.log( typeof 30 );
    console.log( typeof 'Peter Taal' );
</pre>

<p>
    We got the results 'number' and 'string'. Everything in 
    JavaScript has a type, we can even do some type cohersion:
</p>
<pre>
    console.log( typeof +'30' );
    console.log( typeof Number('30') );
    console.log( parseInt('08') + ' is of type: ' + typeof parseInt('08') );
</pre>

<p>
    <b>Side note:</b> Do not use <code>parseInt</code> unless you know what you're doing. With <code>parseInt</code>
    you can specify a radix for your number system, and it used to default to 8 instead of 10; so people tend to get
    really confused about casting strings to numbers. A better way would be to use the following:
</p>
<pre>
    console.log( Number('12') );
    // or even shorter:
    console.log( +'21' );
    // and rounding decimals:
    console.log( Number( '12.2345678' ).toFixed( 4 ) );
</pre>


<p>
    As you can see, even casting in JavaScript is pain and simple! Now lets get back to our objects and see of what
    type they are:
</p>
<pre>
    var person = {};
    console.log( typeof person );
</pre>

<p>
    As we can see, person is of type 'object'. But what if we wanted to be more specific? 'object' is quite general and
    maybe we'll want to make some decisions based on the type of the object.
</p>
<p>
    Here we get to constructor functions. A constructor function is a function which automatically gets a new object
    as it's function context (we'll discuss function context in the next chapter). If it does not return an object it
    returns it's function context. Lets see how this works:
</p>

<h2>Custom types</h2>
<pre>
    function Human () {}
    var human = new Human();
    console.log(typeof human);
</pre>

<p> 
    This still prints out 'object'. But wait, we have another keyword in JavaScript called 'instanceof' which might help:
</p>
<pre>
    function Human () {}
    var human = new Human();
    console.log( human instanceof Human );
    console.log( human instanceof Object );
</pre>
<p>
This is cool. Now we can test for types. A simple pattern for
inherritance could be:
</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<pre>
    /* the human constructor */
    function Human () {}
    var human = new Human();
    
    /* the person constructor */
    function Person () {}
    Person.prototype = Human.prototype;

    var peter = new Person();
    console.log( 'Is Peter a Person?  ' + (human instanceof Person) );
    console.log( 'Is Peter a Human?   ' + (human instanceof Human) );
    console.log( 'Is Peter an Object? ' + (human instanceof Object) );
</pre>

<p>
But wait, what is this 'prototype' property on the object, I
did not specify this!
</p><p>
Every object in JavaScript has a prototype chain. This links
our classes together and creates a path at runtime which can
be used to find properties and methods on the object through
the inherritance chain.
</p><p>
Prototypal inherritance is something which comes from the 
language 'self'. There are only two ways of programming in an
object orriented way, the first is classical OOP the way we 
all know and *shivers* love in C#. Twenty years later, 
developed by industry giants we get this new form called 
prototypal inherritance. This was not done out of ignorance,
but because these people really thought it was better...and 
it is.
</p><p>
Without going into too much detail about the history and the
art of programming I want to spend a little time on this
subject. Before you start programming in a classical language
you need to know the entire taxonomy if the system. The other
option is continuous refactoring. With JavaScript, when you
program correctly in JavaScript, you do not have these issues.
Your objects evolve and shift naturally and you can focus on 
the most important parts of your code and that is the system
and it's functionality.
